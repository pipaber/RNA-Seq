<p>The analysis of RNA-Seq data involves two distinct parts. The first one needs the use of servers or HPC (high performance computers) and has to do with quality control. pre-processing, alignment-mapping (usually with the STAR software) and counting (can be done using RSEM software). The second one is called downstream analysis and this part involves differential gene expression, gene sets analysis, etc.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of facility to use a server or hpc the first part of the RNA-Seq analysis won’t be done but, you can use the <em>rnaseq pipeline</em> from <a href="https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.14.0">nfcore</a>. In my experience, the best combination is to use fastq + STAR + RSEM combination of software for this part of the analysis.</p>
<p>With respect to the second part of the analysis, on this document we’ll see how to analyze the airway data set which is a treatment of dexametasome on specific cell lines. Specifically, differentially gene expression, gene sets enrichment analysis and network analysis will be performed.</p>

<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-data-methods"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Data &amp; Methods</h2>
<p>We are gonna use the airway dataset from the <code>airway</code> package. Part of the analysis will be: - Differential gene expression using <code>DESeq2</code>. - Gene set analysis with fgsea from Cluster profiler. - Network analysis with networkx.</p>

<p>In the context of bioinformatics, applying the concept of hubs and authorities to analyze gene sets and individual genes can offer insightful perspectives on the functional importance and interaction dynamics within genetic networks.</p>
<p>Gene sets or genes with high hub scores may represent critical regulatory functions or be involved in central biological processes. They could be key to understanding disease mechanisms, identifying potential therapeutic targets, or uncovering fundamental aspects of cellular function.</p>
<p>Gene sets or genes identified as high authorities could be central to multiple biological pathways, making them potential biomarkers for diseases or targets for therapeutic intervention. Their importance in various processes makes them subjects of interest for further research and analysis.</p>
