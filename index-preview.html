href=\"http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007015\" target=\"_blank\">GO:0007015<\/a><\/h4><br>actin filament organization<br><br>The series of events required for an organism to<br>receive a sensory temperature stimulus, convert<br>it to a molecular signal, and recognize and<br>characterize the signal. This is a neurological<br>process.<br>NA<br>Any process that activates, maintains or<br>increases the frequency, rate or extent of<br>nervous system development, the origin and<br>formation of nervous tissue.<br>The directed movement of the hexose<br>monosaccharide glucose into a cell or organelle.<br>The process in which the anatomical structures of<br>the hair follicle are generated and organized.<br>The process in which a monosaccharide is<br>transported across a lipid bilayer, from one side<br>of a membrane to the other. Monosaccharides are<br>the simplest carbohydrates; they are polyhydric<br>alcohols containing either an aldehyde or a keto<br>group and between three to ten or more carbon<br>atoms. They form the constitutional repeating<br>units of oligo- and polysaccharides.<br>Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or<br>extent of nervous system development, the origin<br>and formation of nervous tissue.<br>Any process that modulates the frequency or<br>amplitude of synaptic transmission, the process<br>of communication from a neuron to a target<br>(neuron, muscle, or secretory cell) across a<br>synapse. Amplitude, in this case, refers to the<br>change in postsynaptic membrane potential due to<br>a single instance of synaptic transmission.<br>Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or<br>extent of trans-synaptic signaling.<br>The process in which the anatomical structures of<br>the epidermis are generated and organized. The<br>epidermis is the outer epithelial layer of an<br>animal, it may be a single layer that produces an<br>extracellular material (e.g. the cuticle of<br>arthropods) or a complex stratified squamous<br>epithelium, as in the case of many vertebrate<br>species.<br>Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or<br>extent of the peroxisome proliferator activated<br>receptor signaling pathway.<br>The cellular developmental process involved in<br>cell fate commitment in which the cell is<br>designated to follow a developmental path, unless<br>they receive extrinsic cues that direct an<br>alternative fate.<br>The process in which hexose is transported across<br>a membrane. Hexoses are aldoses with a chain of<br>six carbon atoms in the molecule.<br>Any process that reduces or removes the toxicity<br>of inorganic compounds. These include transport<br>of such compounds away from sensitive areas and<br>to compartments or complexes whose purpose is<br>sequestration of inorganic compounds.<br>Any process that results in a change in state or<br>activity of a cell (in terms of movement,<br>secretion, enzyme production, gene expression,<br>etc.) as a result of a zinc ion stimulus.<br>The chemical reactions and pathways resulting in<br>the formation of compounds that contain sulfur,<br>such as the amino acids methionine and cysteine<br>or the tripeptide glutathione.<br>The attachment of a cell to the underlying<br>substrate via adhesion molecules.<br>Any process that results in a change in state or<br>activity of a cell (in terms of movement,<br>secretion, enzyme production, gene expression,<br>etc.) as a result of an insulin stimulus. Insulin<br>is a polypeptide hormone produced by the islets<br>of Langerhans of the pancreas in mammals, and by<br>the homologous organs of other organisms.<br>The process in which the structures of a neuron<br>are generated and organized. This process occurs<br>while the initially relatively unspecialized cell<br>is acquiring the specialized features of a<br>neuron.<br>The series of molecular signals initiated by<br>binding of a ligand to any of the peroxisome<br>proliferator activated receptors (alpha, beta or<br>gamma) in the nuclear membrane, and ending with<br>the initiation or termination of the<br>transcription of target genes.<br>Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or<br>extent of the import of the hexose monosaccharide<br>glucose into a cell or organelle.<br>Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or<br>extent of glucose transport across a membrane.<br>Glucose transport is the directed movement of the<br>hexose monosaccharide glucose into, out of or<br>within a cell, or between cells, by means of some<br>agent such as a transporter or pore.<br>Any process that activates or increases the<br>frequency, rate or extent of activity of the<br>transcription factor CREB.<br>Any process in which skeletal muscles change<br>their phenotypic profiles in response to altered<br>functional demands and a variety of signals.<br>Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or<br>extent of cell-substrate adhesion.
